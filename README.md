# Suppressed Data
  This project is an attempt to connect python with GIS; the goal of the project is to be able to input a name or field for the code to go through a database and export relevant information so that it can spit out only information that is not suppressed or unavailable. This includes 1142 counties from 11 states on the map. I have a geodatabase that I have created with a shapefile with Gun Violence data and the attributes attached to it. If the fields that will be used for the mapping have suppressed data from that specific county in the field, it will clip out that county. This project DOES require ArcGIS to run.
