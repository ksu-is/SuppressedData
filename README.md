# Suppressed Data
  This project is an attempt to connect python with GIS; the goal of the project is to be able to input a name or field for the code to go through a database and export relevant information so that it can spit out only information that is not suppressed or unavailable. This includes 1142 counties from 11 states on the map. I have a geodatabase that I have created with shapefiles for Poverty data & Gun Violence data and attributes attached to them. If the fields that will be used for the mapping like "Poverty Rate (%)" or "Deaths by Gun Violence Rate (%)" have suppressed data from that specific county, it will clip out that county. This project DOES require ArcGIS to run.
